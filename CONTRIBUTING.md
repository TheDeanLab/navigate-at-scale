1. If your plugin has a GUI, please rename files: `plugins_template/view/plugin_name_frame.py` and `plugins_template/controller/plugin_name_controller.py`.
Make sure the name is consistent with plugin_name in `plugin_config.yml`.

2. If your plugin has a new device, please rename the folder name `plugins_template/model/devices/plugin_device` to indicate the device type. Edit the files inside this folder to interact with the new device.
