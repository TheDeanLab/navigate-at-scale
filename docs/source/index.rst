**navigate-at-scale** is a plugin for **navigate**, which aims to enable high-throughput
microscopy. It is designed to work with a Mecademic Meca500 robotic arm and a Thorlabs
HDR50 rotation stage. The plugin provides a user-friendly interface for setting up and
running high-throughput imaging experiments.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. See our `GitHub repository for updates
   <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate-at-scale>`_.

.. warning::

    Please be advised that while the Dean Lab has implemented several safeguards in the
    automation of hardware, including but not limited to stage limits, voltage minimums,
    and maximums, are more, there are inherent risks associated with the use of such
    automated systems. Despite these precautions, the complexity and nature of automated
    hardware can lead to unpredictable outcomes. Therefore, the Dean Lab and UT
    Southwestern expressly disclaim any responsibility for any damages, losses, or
    injuries that may arise from or be related to the use of **navigate**.
    Users should be aware of these risks and agree to utilize **navigate** at their own risk.
