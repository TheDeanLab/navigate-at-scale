Custom vials
==============================

The custom vials are designed to maintain the orientation of the sample within the sample tray.
They are printed using PLA filament and glass vials with solution are then inserted into the holder.

The final vial sleeve design features a chamfered edge so it can only fit in the rotation stage in one orientation. While originally the vial sleeve was intended to hold the BABB solution itself, it has been finalized to hold a small glass vial inside of the sleeve. This decision mitigates the likelihood of any unforeseen chemical reaction between the polymer-based vial sleeve and solution and thus ensures that the design tolerances remain unchanged. Doing this also allows for compatibility with other vials used in the UTSW lab.


Vial Headers
============================

The vial headers are used to hold the stem attached to the sample clamp. Beneath the component is hole for a threaded insert. This will allow for various stems for the sample to be attached.

The header displays the alterations implemented including the chamfered edges and the increase in height. Both of these changes allow for better tolerancing with the vial sleeves and robot operations. These are printed using PLA filament and a threaded insert has been placed into the bottom of the header which allows Dr. Deanâ€™s lab to customize the types of sample holders used for imaging. The two holes on the upper face of the header are used for the neodymium magnets purchased instead of the Thorlabs magnets. This decision is more cost effective with no compromise.

For a more economical option in lieu of the specialty Thorlabs magnets, neodymium magnets were chosen and directly attached into the vial header. Each header piece is printed with 2-hole inserts onto the top, which closely match the diameter of the magnets purchased via McMaster. To ensure the magnets are properly attached to the top, one drop of adhesive is applied into the hole before magnet insertion. After this process, the magnets are permanently attached to the header. The magnet polarity has been confirmed with the Thorlabs microscope assembly attachment piece during installation. Gloves must be used to prevent adhesive from contacting the skin during the process.
Threaded inserts are installed at the bottom of the header for the sample holding attachments created by UTSW. The bore at the bottom of the header is designed to have a smaller diameter than that of the insert to establish a secured bond between the insert and PLA. To lodge the threaded insert, first align the hardware with the hole and apply heat from a soldering iron directly to the insert. This will melt the plastic around it, leading the insert to be carefully pushed down until flush with the surface. Avoid any fumes created with a mask or fume hood.
